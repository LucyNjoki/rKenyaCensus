Introducing rKenyaCensus

rKenyaCensus is an R package that contains the 2019 Kenya Population and Housing Census results. The results were released by the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics in February 2020. The results were published in four different pdf files (Volume 1 - Volume 4). These files can be downloaded from these link.
--------------------------------------------

The 2019 Kenya Population and Housing Census was the eighth to be conducted in Kenya since 1948 and was conducted from the night of 24th /25th to 31st August 2019. Kenya leveraged on technology to capture data during cartographic mapping, enumeration and data transmission, making the 2019 Census the first paperless census (yeeeeyyy!!) to be conducted in Kenya.
--------------------------------------------

Each table has been scrapped and given a unique identifier, e.g V1.T2.3 is the data in table 2.3 of volume 1. To learn more about the different datasets, load the DataCatalogue dataset.

I began by creating the rCensus package itself. I then used the tabulizer R package to scrap the data from the different pdfs. I faced a small glitch while trying to scrap two or three of the datasets, so for those tables, I used data that had already been scrapped, and was readily available on the internet. "Attaching" the data on the package was a very interesting (rather simple I may say) process.
--------------------------------------------

I decided to come up with the package for a host of reasons. To begin with, I believe that people prefer working with data when it is in an "easy to use" format, as opposed to it being in pdf format. The data has been simplified so that data analysts can play around with it, without having to go through the "dirty" process themselves. I also wanted to learn package development through a real life project. I am glad that I can now use the `usethis::use_data(xxx, overwrite = T)` command, and I know what `r cmd-check` is (thanks Jenny Bryan). I also needed to work on a project that I could showcase, when asked "What did you do while you were unemployed?" by my next potential employer. I hope I get to be asked this question soon (yes, I am job hunting).
--------------------------------------------

Most of the datasets are exactly as they appear in the pdf files, but for some, I was able to manipulate them a little bit so that amazing stories could be told from the data. (Insert screenshot here).

I also got some county shapefile data from a friend (thanks Carol), and included them in this package, so that spatial data analysts could use this to develop awesome maps (I can't wait to see what you all come up with).
--------------------------------------------

One of the major lessons that I learnt from the process is that having skills to handle regular expressions is very important. A huge thanks to my friends at the R4DS community who were able to answer some of the questions I had. I hope that I will become better at handling regular expressions, soon.

--------------------------------------------

I want to appreciate my friends(Mutiso, Tabby, Eric, Nangira, Evelyne, AnnMaureen, Caren and Peter), for taking their time to check the data against the data in the pdf files. We are confident that this work is error free, but please raise an alarm if you think something is amiss. I am also grateful to friends who helped me decide on the backgroud photo to use for the poster, (Nairobi is a beautiful city!!). I also want to thank the amazing Mutiso, who spent some hours generating the amazing graphics that are embedded on this post. Mutiso has been generating awesome #TidyTuesday graphs as well, please check his profile. Lastly, a big thanks to the R4DS community who offer a safe space to ask questions, and interact with R enthusiasts all over the world.

--------------------------------------------

This package is still work in progress, I am yet to work on Volume 4 of the results. I will send an update once I am done with that. I am also hoping to submit the package to CRAN (oh, wish me luck!!).
I am happy to discuss further improvements to the package, so please feel free to contact me through the contact form, at the bottom of my website. Again, incase you come across a bug, please do reach out as well.

--------------------------------------------
Parting shot: If you have an amazing idea, start working on it, the end product will satisfy your soul.

Guess what!! We shall overcome Covid19, but before then, keep safe, stay at home, wash your hands regularly and if you have to leave your premises, please wear a mask. It shall be well.

--------------------------------------------
Adios!!
